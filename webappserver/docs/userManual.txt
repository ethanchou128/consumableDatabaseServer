USER MANUAL FOR THE NO MOLD = GOLD DATABASE

Upon startup, the program will show the main user interface with all items listed.

The main screen will have 4 buttons placed at the top of the screen:

"All" - this button turns off all listing item filters and lists all items in order
by earliest expiry date, whether the date has passed or not.

"Expired" - this button turns on a filter to only show the expired items in the system,
by earliest expiry date. The sooner it expired, the higher up it is on the list.

"Non-Expired Items" - this button filters out all the non-expired items and only shows the
items that are still fresh. The sooner it expires, the higher it is on the list.

"Expires within 7 Days" - this button only displays the items that expire within the current
date and 7 days past it. The sooner it expires, the higher it is on the list.

The main screen will also have three buttons placed at the bottom of the screen, as well as a
helpful label showing the current date:

"Add Item" - this button will open a JDialog asking for user input for each field of a new item
that the user wants to add. If he/she changes their mind and does not want to add anymore, simply
click on the exit button to return to the main listing menu safely.

"Delete Item" - this button also opens a JDialog, but instead it asks for the item number of the item
that the user wants to remove. If an invalid input is attempted to be input, a helpful dialog box pops up
asking the user to try again. Similar to the add item interface, if the user changes his/her mind, simply
just click cancel button to return to main menu safely.

"Quit" - this button simply exits the program while simultaneously writing all the items in the database into
a new (or existing) .json file. Offers an alternative for closing the window with the X in top right.
